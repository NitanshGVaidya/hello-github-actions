Hello All ,

Today is my last day at LTI and I am feeling very nostalgic right now . As I hate Goodbyes it is very hard to say this to you all.
I am grateful to everyone who have helped and supported me, with whom I have achieved a lifetime friendship, my colleagues, Juniors and all my managers.

I joined L&T Infotech in Jan-2018 , a fun-filled roller coaster over more than 3.5 challenging and equally rewarding years. It has been a fantastic journey and a great learning experience for me. I enjoyed every moment and I appreciate having the opportunity to work with you.

I would like to take this opportunity to say SINCERE THANKS to all my supervisors Vinay, Shuchita and Nitin G who have helped me grow as a professional and as a person with their extended support & valuable guidance during my tenure. 🙌

I would also like to express WARM THANKS to Shrikant C, Swara, Nikita D, Akshay, Manjiri, Tanuj, Nitin B, Priyanka R, Nisha, Neha K, Sagar G, Haresh G, Keval, Shrinidhi S, Vrushali N, Sheetal D and all colleagues(sorry whom I missed here) for their untiring support and displaying their faith in me. 👩‍💻👨‍💻
